    #
    # The Knife Provisioner does three major things:
    #
    # * Bootstraps a series of machines living on IP addresses supplied to it
    # * Ensures that they converged successfully (if not, raises and displays output)
    # * Waits until chef has indexed their metadata
    #
    # On deprovision, it deletes the nodes and clients related to this server group.
    #
    # Machines are named as such: $server_group-$number, where $number starts at 0
    # and increases with the number of servers requested. Your node names will be
    # named this as well as the clients associated with them.
    #
    # It does as much of this as it can in parallel, but stalls the current thread
    # until the subthreads complete. This allows is to work as quickly as possible
    # in a 'serial' scheduling scenario as we know bootstrapping can always occur
    # in parallel for the group.
